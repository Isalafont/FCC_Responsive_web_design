              <strong>My baby just cares for me </strong>
              <p>It wasn’t until 1987, when My Baby Just Cares for Me exploded in Europe. That said, the exposure – the song featured in a perfume commercial – brought Simone to a new audience and allowed her to work only when she needed to until her death in 2003. (She recorded only one more studio album, A Single Woman, in 1993). It’s astonishing that My Baby Just Cares for Me managed to remain relatively obscure for so long given how good it is, featuring a jaw-dropping virtuoso piano solo that is the perfect conflation of her classical training and jazz improvisation, while her dolorous timbre, set against a prideful narrative and generally upbeat mood, creates an odd paradox.</p>

              <strong>Mississipi Goddam </strong>
              <p>With standards in her repertoire such as Work Song evoking the backbreaking toil of the chain gang, it was clear Simone’s sympathies were with the civil rights movement in the early 60s, but a self-penned protest song in response to cold-blooded murder saw her emerge as a figurehead in 1964. Civil rights activist Medgar Evers had been assassinated by a member of the White Citizens’ Council the year before, as well as the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama, where four young girls were killed. Mississippi Goddam is a frustrated call to arms, a plea for mercy, a recalcitrant cry of defiance and an angry voice of reason crying out against the most untenable and unjust of situations. Mississippi Goddam was controversial, not least because of the cursing in its title. “We released it as a single and it sold well, except in the south where we had trouble with distribution,” wrote Simone. “The excuse was profanity – Goddam! – but the real reason was obvious enough.”</p>

             <strong>Sinnerman </strong>
             <p>The origin of Sinnerman (or Sinner Man before Simone dispensed with the spacing) is ambiguous, some claiming the traditional African-American spiritual started life as a Scottish folk song. Sinnerman has become one of her trademark songs, and listening to its 11 minutes of heart-racing rhythms, thrills and spills and inspired moments of spontaneous invention, it’s not difficult to see how she picked up the High Priestess of Soul epithet. Simone performed many times in New York during the 60s, and her dream of playing Carnegie Hall was realised in 1963 but for one caveat: she wasn’t there to play her beloved Bach.</p>

              <strong>I put a spell on you </strong>
              <p>Simone didn’t write many of her own songs, but – as one of the finest interpreters of others’ tunes – she hardly needed to. Take Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ I Put a Spell on You, written in 1956. “I was just a normal blues singer. I was just Jay Hawkins,” said the composer. “It all sort of just fell in place. I found out I could do more destroying a song and screaming it to death.” It’s a deeply enjoyable, if slightly jarring, voodoo waltz with some sinister barking when Hawkins performs it in his bellicose fashion. At least that’s how it sounds compared with Simone’s version, which is smoother than a polished palatial floor. The swirling brass at the outset followed by Simone’s deep alto scowl, and then those irresistible, skittering glissandos can hardly fail to imbue the sense one is beholding something classic upon each listen. I Put a Spell on You glides effortlessly in through your ear, and before you know it, it has you right where it wants you.</p>

              <strong>Feeling Good</strong> 
              <p>Simone might have resented being called a jazz musician but it’s hard to deny the big-band oomph of Feeling Good, possibly her best-loved song. Simone’s Feeling Good was yet another song that benefited from repeat plays on a 80’s commercial (this time for fabric conditioner) and since then it has been sampled a number of times by hip-hop artists, including Kanye West, for New Day on the Watch the Throne album with Jay Z. Aside from throwing in a megaphone, Muse were faithful to Simone’s arrangement when they covered it in 2001, a rendering NME readers voted best cover version of all time in 2010, which one hopes caused Muse some embarrassment.</p>
